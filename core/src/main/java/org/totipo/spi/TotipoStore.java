/** Experimental provider SPI. Understands root/vault/objects-v1 and opaque storage only.
 * Construction is read-only. Calls are synchronous; inputs remain caller-owned.
 * Writes neither mutate nor retain caller arrays without copying.
 * Passing this store to Totipo.open/create transfers ownership on every outcome.
 * Calls are serialized by core; providers need not support concurrent use of one handle.
 * Close is idempotent and never removes canonical state. */
