# Totipo Java

Portable Java libraries targeting Totipo Vault Format v1, revision **r18**.
The exact committed specification and language-neutral corpus are pinned in
[SPEC_PIN.md](SPEC_PIN.md).

Normal Java clients should start with `NioTotipo.open(path, password)` or
`NioTotipo.create(path, password)` in `org.totipo.storage.nio`, then use the
`org.totipo` application API: `VaultSession`, immutable `VaultState` projections,
create/update/merge builders and session-backed TOTP. The directory must already
exist. These entry points and saves may block; inspect their explicit lifecycle
and persistence results. See [API_DESIGN.md](API_DESIGN.md) for the contracts and
[facade implementation evidence](review/PUBLIC_API_FACADE_REPORT.md) for coverage.
Provider integrations use the deliberate `org.totipo.spi` boundary, implemented
by `NioTotipoStore`. This SPI is experimental, not frozen for source/binary
compatibility. Providers understand only storage layout and storage semantics;
protocol interpretation stays in core. Ordinary applications need no SPI types.
See [SPI_DESIGN.md](SPI_DESIGN.md) for the boundary and ownership contract.

This repository has completed the r18 portable core implementation milestone:
**90/90 portable corpus cases implemented, none deferred**. The TOKEN codec,
graph/fold, TOKEN storage/authorship/publication, and VAULT lifecycle are complete
for this corpus. Configured-store observation validates TOKENs
for explicit graph evaluation; authorship planning uses caller-selected parents,
complete values, and exact metadata. Immutable publication executes ordinary or
linear-carry fold plans with safe explicit retries.
Consumers cover bootstrap, crypto, encoding, fold, graph, metadata, size,
storage, TOTP, and all eight vault workflow cases.
Implementation evidence is executable in
[Phase2ConformanceTest](core/src/test/java/org/totipo/format/Phase2ConformanceTest.java).
Snapshot/profile integrity tests separately verify all 90 target cases. There is no full Java API stability
promise yet; most core implementation types remain package-private. Corpus completion
is not the end of API design or implementation hardening, and does not establish
desktop/Android readiness or an independent production security audit.
Independent interoperability has not yet been demonstrated, and this milestone
does not claim release readiness. NIO provider qualification is limited to the
local case-sensitive Linux filesystem tested here; exact canonical naming and
the required operation capabilities must be qualified on each target provider.

r18 conformance claims are scoped by supported operation (§20). The protocol
foundation in `core` is **v1 core conforming** for bootstrap reading/creation/rewrap,
object crypto and identity, TOKEN encoding/validation and exact object metadata,
graph/current-state computation, complete-value equality, bounded folds and TOTP.
The audited facade TOKEN projections and metadata handling in create/update/merge,
including partial resolution and frozen publication retries, are included in these
core operations. Exposed and captured heads preserve exact per-object metadata.
`ApplicationSession.CausalFact` retains causal/topological facts derived from a
validated TOKEN but does not retain or represent that TOKEN object itself. The
previous historical-metadata qualification is resolved by the
[focused §12 audit](review/V1_R18_CAUSAL_FACT_METADATA_REPORT.md). This is an
operation-scoped claim, not certification of every facade operation.
See [API scope and application responsibilities](API_DESIGN.md#r18-conformance-scope-and-application-responsibilities).

The `storage-nio` provider with core's low-level observation/publication/VAULT
orchestration is **v1 store conforming** for those supported operations: observation,
immutable publication, no-replace creation, replacement, exact compare-before-replace
and explicit durability results. This claim retains the provider and filesystem
qualifications above and below; abstract tests do not prove physical power-loss
behavior on every filesystem. The NIO SPI alone does not authenticate protocol bytes;
core supplies that validation and the exact comparison before replacement.

**v1 application conformance is not claimed.** A reusable library and its state API
do not implement the application's confirmations, warnings, truthful presentation,
alternative disclosure or safe rendering of untrusted text. Interactive applications
must confirm empty-password creation and should warn/confirm when available
pre-creation observation finds possible orphan objects. Empty passwords remain
readable, and unauthenticated orphan-looking names do not veto creation. Tombstones
retain secrets and history; deletion is not secure erasure. Rewrap retains the same
root with fresh salt/nonce; it does not revoke old wrappers or recover a compromised
root. These are application responsibilities even when the library supplies data.

The two production modules are:

- `core`: portable Java 17 Totipo primitives and protocol foundation: bootstrap and
  Argon2id, root/object crypto, private keyed object identity, authenticated fixed
  envelopes, exact TOKEN semantics and TLV codec, causal groups and current heads,
  deterministic fold construction, password handling, Java credential values, TOTP, entropy,
  configured-store TOKEN observation and authorship planning/publication,
  VAULT creation/open/password rewrap, and storage observation/publication/bootstrap SPIs.
- `storage-nio`: portable Java 17 configured-store filesystem implementation:
  direct-child discovery, immutable object publication, bootstrap storage, and an
  injectable directory durability capability. It depends on `core`.

`core` depends on Bouncy Castle `bcprov` for lightweight Argon2id. Other crypto uses
JDK providers. Jackson and JUnit are test-only. Both modules compile with
`--release 17`, and build checks inspect every production class for Java 17 bytecode.
The build JVM/toolchain remains JDK 25; the Gradle wrapper, dependency locks, and
verification metadata remain pinned. No Linux-native module is currently required.

Build and test with the repository wrapper in the existing Nix development shell
(`nix develop`, or `direnv allow`), or with JDK 25 available:

```sh
./gradlew clean test build
./gradlew :core:test
./gradlew :storage-nio:test
./gradlew --offline --no-daemon --no-build-cache --rerun-tasks clean test
```

The complete local integration suite assumes a case-sensitive filesystem, symlink
and hard-link support, atomic moves over existing targets where tested, directory
channels accepting force, POSIX permissions, and `mkfifo` for POSIX fixtures.
These are test-environment assumptions, not all protocol requirements. Some
provider integration fixtures report unsupported capabilities through JUnit
assumptions; the normative 90-case conformance inventory must still execute
90/90 without skips. Portable semantic conformance and provider integration
evidence are separate: case-sensitive-host tests do not qualify case-insensitive
providers. Windows, macOS, Android, and physical crash/power-loss behavior remain
unqualified by this suite.

Directory durability is attempted using `NioDurability` and pure Java NIO.
`NioDurability` is a pure-Java runtime capability. Successful return means the
provider accepted the requested directory-channel force operation; unsupported
providers fail rather than being treated as durable. Java SE does not guarantee
directory fsync semantics on every provider. `StorageDurability` stays injectable
for a future supported backend if needed. No native-access JVM flags are required.

Provider scans expose all observed direct children of the exact `objects-v1`
directory, with no-follow kind and optional logical length observations. Core
selects canonical lowercase-hex regular candidates and reports namespace/enumeration
issues diagnostically. Candidate bytes
are hostile; the TOKEN reader composes bounded reads, envelope authentication, and
exact grammar validation. Diagnostics preserve independently valid observations
and imply no global operation gate. Valid bytes do not certify the observed set
or its freshness. Graph evaluation explicitly consumes the validated subset.
Canonical namespace, existing object, and `vault` lookups select exact observed
direct-child directory-entry spellings. Alternate-case siblings are ignored;
provider alias collisions during no-replace creation fail conservatively.

Default/shared TOKEN and initial VAULT installation use no-replace hard links.
The SPI NIO provider
attempts atomic replacement, falling back to a non-atomic move when atomic move is
unsupported; the legacy low-level adapter retains its atomic-only contract. VAULT workflows
open only lowercase `vault`, read at most 88 bytes, authenticate complete candidates
and their separate stages, and preserve the exact root across password changes.
Replacement re-observes canonical bytes and requires exact equality with authenticated
BASE immediately before the backend attempt. This is compare-before-replace, not
atomic CAS; the remaining race is an explicit v1 limitation. Ambiguous acknowledgements
never report success or trigger automatic rollback/retry. Orphan TOKEN files do not
block creation, and rewrap does not inspect or rewrite TOKENs.

The explicit `NioTotipoStore.openPrivate(root)` factory supports an
application-private/exclusive local replica using complete forced stages and
moves without replacement options for new objects and initial VAULT creation.
Only the application may ordinarily write the root; synchronization software
must not mutate it directly. The application must serialize all operations across
every writer, handle/session and bridge operation using that root, and reconcile
remote bytes through a separate controlled bridge. Core serialization covers only
one session. This mode retains
durability requests and explicit uncertainty; it provides no atomic no-replace
guarantee against concurrent writers. It is inappropriate for a desktop's directly
synchronized/shared directory; continue using shared mode there unless separately
qualified. Existing `open` factories and `NioTotipo` entry
points retain hard links, with no automatic fallback. Use
`Totipo.create(NioTotipoStore.openPrivate(root), password)` or the corresponding
`Totipo.open` call; normal store ownership rules apply.
See [the portability investigation](review/NIO_PRIVATE_LOCAL_PORTABILITY_REPORT.md).

The vault fingerprint recognizes a root; it proves neither freshness nor authorization.
No remembered fingerprint is required to open. A saved old wrapper and its password
can still recover the root after rewrap; v1 does not provide rollback protection.
Tests exercise force operations, close/reopen persistence, and injected failures,
not universal physical power-loss guarantees.

TOKEN publication acknowledges
the local configured store only; it implies no remote propagation. Plans retain
neither roots nor canonical plaintext. Caller parents may be unavailable; duplicate
parent input is rejected. Partial fold publication remains ordinary immutable
history, and the same plan can be retried explicitly after failure.

The test snapshot is under `core/src/test/resources/totipo-spec/v1-pre-rc/` and is
excluded from production JARs. Java derives behavior from the normative
specification and language-neutral corpus, not from the Go implementation.

To intentionally refresh build reproducibility inputs, use `bootstrap-m0.sh` and
review the resulting wrapper, Nix lock, module dependency locks, and verification
metadata changes. Normal builds do not regenerate specification vectors.

## Maven consumption

The Maven coordinates for published Java implementation version **0.1.4** are
shown below.
Maven Central is the binary distribution channel; the manually dispatched
[Release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml) validates, signs, publishes and
verifies each release before creating its source tag and GitHub release.
Applications consuming that version use Maven Central and:

```kotlin
implementation("org.totipo:totipo-storage-nio:0.1.4")
```

`totipo-storage-nio` is the normal filesystem/NIO entry point and provider. It
exposes `totipo-core` transitively, including `VaultSession` and `VaultState`.
Use `NioTotipo` and the high-level application API; the SPI guidance above remains
unchanged. For portable protocol/application API and core implementation without
an NIO provider:

```kotlin
implementation("org.totipo:totipo-core:0.1.4")
```

Core brings Bouncy Castle 1.86 at runtime for Argon2id, without exposing BC as a
public compile dependency. Both artifacts require Java 17; tests, test fixtures,
and the specification snapshot are excluded from publications.

`VERSION` is the single implementation version source. Protocol compatibility is
separate: this worktree targets v1/r18, aligned from the prior v1/r17 pin without
portable behavior changes. `VERSION` is prepared as **0.1.5**, adding
`VaultSession.validateObject(...)` to validate externally obtained immutable object
representations against an already-open authenticated vault without importing
them or exposing root key material. It requires no password re-entry or KDF.
The result is Invalid or a defensively owned exact validated ciphertext snapshot;
it establishes neither freshness, current-head status nor persistence.
The consumption examples above describe published 0.1.4; 0.1.5 is prepared,
unreleased and under local review.
See [the 0.1.5 preparation report](review/V0_1_5_RELEASE_PREPARATION_REPORT.md)
and [draft release notes](review/V0_1_5_RELEASE_NOTES.md).
Specification revisions do not mechanically dictate Java semantic versions.
See [the release checklist](RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md) for exact provenance,
credential-free validation and the protected release-environment approval gate.
The [J1.1 namespace migration report](review/J1_1_NAMESPACE_MIGRATION_REPORT.md)
records the namespace migration and supersedes J1 coordinates. The v0.1.1
preparation validation is recorded in the
[release-preparation report](review/V0_1_1_RELEASE_PREPARATION_REPORT.md), with
[release notes](review/V0_1_1_RELEASE_NOTES.md).
Publication checks additionally require Python 3.9+ (standard library only).
